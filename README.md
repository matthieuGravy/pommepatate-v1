Pommepatate is my very first portfolio, designed with simplicity and speed in mind, aiming not to deter recruiters during their visit to the site. Although I haven't yet finalized version 2, its creation and integration have been extremely swift, largely thanks to the use of high-performance components included in the project. It's a rewarding experience to think that I can quickly put up a CV or my creations online. Other projects I've undertaken may perhaps inspire you for its enhancement.

> I'm not a designer, and I'm eagerly looking forward to discovering your talents in this field.

## In this portfolio, you'll find:

- Reusable components that simplify the creation of new pages and functionalities.
- A minor bug with the loader that I'm currently working on fixing.
- A 404 page to ensure smooth navigation even in case of incorrect links.
- The use of slots for advanced content customization.
